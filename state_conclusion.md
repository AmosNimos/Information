# Conclusion

The way most people access information has been completely monopolized and corrupted by organization such as large tech company and governments.
People have been condition to distrust any information not from those controlled media and consider them as false misinformation regardless of the content. 
People use this controlled incomplete bias information to form their perception of reality, and when their perception of reality does not match with reality 
They will reject reality and enter a state of cognitive dissonance. 
Every information that does not fit the narative is hidden by the platform use by the people to share and find information.
these organisation are the ulimate editor, they controle the the narative and band people opignion to their will.
People are kept in a constant state of fear, fear of each other, Hypochondriasis fear of the covid-19 virus, they have been __brainwashed__ and I use them very precisely,
The method used to brainwash people are not knew, with the help of big data, it has almost become an exact science.
People have been induced into a constant state of paranoia, they will exhibited the symptoms necessary for a scientific diagnosis.
Rational thinking and provable fact have been replaced in the collective mind given with mass adopted myth as the current stadard of reality.
Indoctrinated into a belief system not unlike religious faith. Worse they have been manipulated and condition to hate specific group that goes against the “Statu quo”.
They have closed the frontier to does that do not adhere to their beliefs, trapping them inside country in a state of mass hysteria.
The minority that did not get the vaccination identification, are threaten to lose their job, and are discriminated against in society, and cannot live normal lives, as if they were lesser being or a threat to society. Their freedom are getting ignored. This is very reminiscent of the social credit system of totalitarian china.
Totalitarianism, Tyranny, Discrimination, Fascism, Police-state, irrationalism, are now words that describe the sad new reality.
People sacrificed their freedom and the freedom of other, in exchange for an illusion of safety.
