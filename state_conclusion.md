people have been condition to distrust any information not from those controlled media and concider them as false missinformation regardless of the content. 
people use this controlled incomplete bias information to form their perception of reality, and when their perception of reality does not match with reality 
they will reject reality and enter a state of cognitive dissonance. 

People are kept in a constant state of fear, fear of each other, Hypochondriasis fear of the covid-19 virus, they have been __brainwashed__ and i use the therm verry precisely,
the methode used to brainwash people are not knew, with the help of big data, it has almost become an exact science.
