#### Personal experience

Things are getting dire here in Quebec Canada, 
Our fundamental civil rights are being ignored, I am baffled at how far the propaganda, the ignorance, 
The hate and discrimination is spreading. 
I was eating alone at the mall at the eating area, I was in the middle of my meal far from everyone, and a guard came to me and ask me if I could show him a vaccination-passport, 
I said no, and he required that I leave immediately. I told the guard that this violated my civil right, and that he should read them, that this was a crime, he told me, 
"I am just doing my job".
The executioner is as responsible as the one giving the order, 
This is just an excuse, and does not make it less of a crime, at best an accomplice. No matter my argument this man, would not, and could not listen to reason.

If this vaccine was so important and so efficient why the actual F would the 80% of vaccinated people,
Fear getting sick from the remaining 20%?
They are supposed to be immune that's how vaccination is supposed to work,
They should not need to fear to catch a virus when they are vaccinated unless this shit they got injected with,
This shit that made billions to the company getting the contract from the government over night without no one getting suspicious, 
This untested shit that was in no way ready to be distributed, is completely and utterly useless and pointless.

Plus there has been almost if not more people who got sick from this vaccine than from the virus, they fear, 
But the data are being represented in a completely bias way.   
We now live in a Fascist state of fear. People have been 
Indoctrinated, conditioned, re-educated, persuaded, propagandized, influence, pressurize into developing severe 
Nosophobia & Hypochondriasis (Illness Anxiety Disorder).
Once drilled into paranoid, hate filled being, they got the majority of the populace to act toward the un-vaccinated, 
Just like the Nazi acted toward Jew in pre-world war II Germany. When people discriminate what group of people can eat where, 
Historically they never ended up being the good guys.

This is discrimination that violate our most basic right, this is pure fascism. We should learn from history, 
Not to repeat its mistake,
But this current situation is no better than telling a man he needs to sit at the back of a bus based on the color of his skin.

The funny thing about miss Information is that most people assume that it must be everything that goes against what they already believe, instead of considering the possibility that their sources might be the one compromised.

Beware of the censorship, every information that differ from the mainstream is getting tagged as misinformation and removed from access.
How can you claim to know anything, if you can only see the information that confirm what you already believe to be fact? This is the blindfold of willing full induced ignorance. If prevented you from seeing and considering the atrocity of his action, a monster doing terrible thing, can only see it self, as a benevolent hero. 
by removing the context by removing every differing view, your create this controlled bias false perception of reality in which every concept can be turned on its head, where good is bad and bad is good.

Mass manipulation, censorship, and hate based discrimination, is nothing new, but if you are blinded to history, you might as well believe it is.

As long as people keep thinking this way things won't improve, they will keep getting worst.
The most dangerous type of tyranny arise gradually unnoticed. As long as they don't make change too drastic, too fast, people will endure almost anything.
Just like a frog in the water will let it self be boiled alive, as long as the water temperature rise slowly enough.

The passport allows fascist politicians to claim that they are not "forcing" people to take the vaccine; they will just make people's lives a living hell if they don't.

Kids at school are getting prevented from going to activities if they don't have this vaccination-passport. This is very similar to china social credit system which was just another tool of totalities discrimination.
This is the unofficial way to force someone to do something. This is basic social blackmail, do what they want or else.
Keep complying and you will be slaves.

Given current trends, COVID-19 may have largely faded by the time vaccine passports are widely accepted, but the documents themselves will undoubtedly remain.

> Only those who could prove they are fully vaccinated, are allowed at least a semblance of normality.
“People can’t live their lives in the new world without them.

A politician famously said, “Never let a crisis go to waste.”  Boy, did this pandemic really see them put their shoulder into that old axiom.

From mask mandates to business shutdowns, from church closings to schools shuttered.  There was very little life that was not impacted by the decisions made by local petty tyrants and their accomplices in the government.

Vaccine passport schemes are likely to exacerbate existing inequality.

The Battle Against Corona Fascism Could Be the Existential Fight of Our Generation.

That ridiculous face-covering mandates and draconian restrictions on the lives and livelihoods of ordinary working peoples will continue indefinitely for years, with no end in sight. Think I’m exaggerating? The World Health Organization is saying even a vaccine won’t “end the pandemic.”
Will the end of the pandemic suffice to "end the pandemic."? I personally highly doubt it. 

The data have been so falsified that the virus propagation might already been over and we wouldn’t even know it...

I don't even know where to start explaining how bad things are, when speaking with people, everything is so illogical that it's even hard to find enough logic around to use as a basis to point out the illogicality of the current situation. 

The government and media have used all manipulation tactics available and have created deep powerful fear at the hearth of the populace with propaganda that people don't even recognize as being propaganda. it is frown upon to question the status quo or speak up about the current arms of the panic state.

People with concerns are getting fired from their jobs only leaving, people who are blind to the current hill in charge of every institution.

They are acting fast next month it will be too late to leave the country if you don't have the vaccination passport, even if you have pass the test that prove you don't have covid.

Here is just a simple hypothesis suggestion, People who get vaccinated, are still getting the covid, so what is telling us for sure the vaccine isn’t the cause? When it is so new and untested? We can't even question it, without being tagged as a paranoid conspiracy theorist anti-vaccine. And other degrading terms, to discredit sometime valid questioning.

Having reserved and being cautious about your health is now seen as a bad thing? Because questioning the benefit versus the side effect of a treatment is just that.
Forcing a treatment on people should not even be something. forcing people to wear things that can potentially arm them should not be a neither, in my country we had law and legislation to prevent such despicable act of fascism, but these fundamental right are getting ignored.

The data they show is so biased, it's even hard to point out every point of bias, when vaccinated people get sick if don't have all the required dose they are entered in the system as unvaccinated. So the data will shot more unvaccinated people getting sick as a result even if the sickness was caused by the vaccine for example.

They corner us in a situation where there is not much way to avoid this predicament, no freedom in the matter. Only tyranny.

For some reason people have blind faith that things just can’t keep getting worst like this for ever, but it historically has, and we have no indication of things getting better any time soon, people feel insulted being compared to Nazi even when the comparison if obvious, they don’t like being called fascism when they act like fascism and support a fascism state, there is misinformation about what misinformation even is, to the point some people believe the only valid information is the one provided by the traditional media the most unrealizable source there has ever been.

This is a state of fear based discrimination, the result of successful propaganda and the use of modern and traditional media as the ultimate brainwashing tool.
When we keep redefining the definition of word, we can't ever be wrong, they keep denying what their actions actually imply.

Just like it is mostly useless to argue with a religious extremists with logic to point out the illogicality of his belief system there is not much to gain in trying to reason people who convince them self that the current situation is justified.

Even with valid argument there, even when simply offering information, people panic, questioning the measure in place equivalent to questioning their faith, they feel like their entire reality is under attack. even when you simply offer factual information to them they dismiss it and make it seems like you are trying to debate them, i heard people say "I don't want to start a debate" when being presented with objective provable and proved facts, this often left me felling sick and agree since there is no way of communicating without them being on the defensive or interpreting the conversation as a form of conflict, they will of course deny this reality. And continue seeing them self as rational people even when face with their irrationality. which is even worst when they are in a position of authority.

I had people dismissing the information of this repository without looking at it simply because it was not mainstream media.
I am just a person with no authority on those topic, but i am still a person capable of doing research and use reasoning.
There is nothing fundamentally dangerous in being expose to someone else reasoning, idea, views, as long as you can use your own to evaluate it, if you still think the information you have been presented is invalid you can questioned it and get to the bottom of it. But I guess that isn’t how things work now, it's a monopole on information a dictatorship on what if valid or invalid view of reality. Not based on evidence but based on the source, only source approved by the mainstream media are considered valid and other should be dismissed without further consideration.

I had people dismissing information without looking at it under the assumption that they are already informed this is invalid reasoning since no information can be complete unless you are omnipotent, and worse your information might be bias or invalid, and simply assuming it is not, is not only pretentious it's simply unreasonable to say the least, it is the definition of being close minded.

How can you truly know something if you never question and reconsider what you assume to know?

We have not succeeded i vanishing religious bullshit from our society, how are we supposed to fight against a faith that is even stronger and against an even bigger disregard for reality logic and fact in favor of mainstream superstition.

I don't assume to be right about anything I claim, that's how i know i could be, because i am prepared to change my mind based on logic. I just bring questioning and definition, i leave the rest to you, to make your own mind and do your own research. Please do prove me wrong, but do it with provable fact, not baseless mainstream beliefs.

Not that I want it, but it has turned in a battle of faith vs fact.

> Advice: As soon as someone try to debate logic with faith and beliefs, don't bother arguing with them, only an idiot argue with a fool.
> They most often assume to be right no matter reality, so leave them in their blissful ignorance, they have clearly choosen to be in complete denial, and i hignly doupt you can reason with the unreasonable and delusion the delusional.

It is sad to see that some people have already made up their mind, they have taken position and wont reconsider it.

A lot of people when face with reality that is different from their pre define perception of reality, will enter a into what is called a cognitive dissonance,
This can happen when they are face with new information that they simply are not mentally ready to consider, this can make them verry angry.
when you realise you are arguing with a persone in that state of mind stop debating. they might even be the one turning the conversation into a debate, then it
is pointless to continue the conversation.
