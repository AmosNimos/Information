# Solution:
## Mask mandate

If you need to go into a private comerce or establishment, 
call 911 ask for the help of an officer to go for you with a mask.
Because you cannot go without a mask and you wish to respect the decreet,
no matter how much it is unjustified unjust, discriminatory and goes against 
previously established law that should legaly nullify it.
if it goes against your personal conviction the police should to help you respect this illogical requirement.
otherwise you will be force to enter without a mask which would be grave enaugh that they would need to come anyway to solve such an alaring situation.
so it goes without saying that they should cooperate in preventing such situation by going inside the comerce in your place t buy or return a product.
